# tracebacks project
# will update more later on project info

* factorial.py is an example of how to use sys.settrace(tracefunc) for identifying frames
 * a function that uses recursion to compute factorials is defined
 * then, a helper function is defined that returns a tuple displaying info on current frame and outer frames
 * this allows us to determine the frame sequences involved in the recursive factorial function

* since factorial.py was written via assistance, fibonnaci.py was written by myself with no helper
 * fibonnaci.md is a a breakdown of my thought process along the way
